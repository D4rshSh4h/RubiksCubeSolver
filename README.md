# Rubiks Cube Solver
This is a virtual implementation of a rubiks cube and an algorithm to solve it.

The cube itself is represented by a series of 2-D numpy arrays, and manipulation is done through rotating the cube and the front face.
 This representation of the cube is done intentionally as later I would like to use this in order to make new software LEGO MINDSTORMS rubiks cube solver (By David Gilday - https://mindcuber.com/mindcub3r/mindcub3r.html)

For now, i've used an already implemented solving algorithm (Git Repo - bellerb/RubiksCube_Solver) and modified it slightly so its compatible with Cube.py. Later I hope to implement more algorithms.

Don't hesitate to improve/fix any code especially from Cube.py!
